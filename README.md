# UFOs

## Purpose

This code is to create a website which displays UFO sightings and allows for filtering of the catalogued sightings based on 4 parameters. The page should update when information is put into the input fields and should populate accordingly.

## Results

The seach area is comprised of a block of search parameters on the left and the results on the right.

The block of search parameters is divided out to search each column. This will allow you to search by multiple parameters at the same time.

![Search Bar](https://github.com/K3Rob/UFOs/blob/main/Additional%20images/search_bar.PNG)

Just enter what you want to search from each of the columns and the results will update accordingly as the script recognizes the change.

## Summary

The site is very simple and has no updating features for the results beyond the search. Because of this all records will need to be manually added at this point. Additional scripts that could be added are; find and scrape for new records followed by an ETL function, could also use some code to create pages within the results to manage load time of the page as more records are added.
